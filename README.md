# Hang In There

### Engineered by Jon Boy and Big Steve

This web application can randomlize quotes, pictures, and titles to brigthen up your day. If you find a poster you like you can save it and view it on the Saved Posters page. While there you'll have the ability to remove unwanted posters by double clicking on the undesired poster. Have a poster you want to make? There is a Make Poster page that takes input and will transfer it to the main page to make available for saving. Data validation will prevent blank input while on this page. 

This web application was designed and created in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.



***USE BEWARE -- NOT ALL QUOTES SHOULD BE TAKEN LITERAL**
